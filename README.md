This is a docker image contains `sbt`, `scala` and `docker engine`

based on [sbt-scala](https://hub.docker.com/r/hseeberger/scala-sbt/)

Need to mount /var/run to this container.

Reference: 
1. [install docker on debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
2. [hseeberger/docker-sbt](https://github.com/hseeberger/docker-sbt)
